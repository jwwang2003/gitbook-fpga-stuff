This is the day of the presentation.

It was a painstakingly long presentation, lasting almost 20mins I think. This was my first time giving a presentation for this long and in a field that is completely new to me. Adding insult to injury, I actually got sick the week before the presentation and on the day of my presentation, my voice had just recovered but not completely. But overall, I think it went pretty well and it was a great experience (rare chance to get an opportunity to give a presentation in this field).
